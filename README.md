## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for our submission to ISMIR 2024. 
The work involves training BERT models for predicting moral values from song lyrics; generating synthetic lyrics and classifying real-life lyrics using LLMs. 
To reuse the repo install the necessary libraries or run:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

#### 1. BERT_Models
This folder contains Python Jupyter Notebook files for training BERT models and predicting moral values in song lyrics. 
The models are fine-tuned on annotated datasets and are designed to understand and predict the representation of moral values based on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).

#### 2. GPT_Models
This folder hosts scripts for lyrics generation and zero-shot classification using GPT models.

#### 3. Lyrics_Data
- MFT_human_annotated_lyrics.csv: This file contains 200 song lyrics annotated by human experts with 10 different MFT values.
- GPT4_generated_songs_with_MFT_values.csv: This file includes 2721 synthetic lyrics with MFT loadings, generated using GPT-4.
