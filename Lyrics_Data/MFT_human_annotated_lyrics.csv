The stockings up on the wall
When sleigh bells ring and children sing

The songs we love to hear

The decorations and celebrations
It's almost christmas day
The night before, anticapating
Santa on his way

It's the perfect holiday

I'll always make one wish
'Cause having all of you right here
Is the perfect christmas gift

And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
But he always speeded up and got away
The old county jail stood patiently awaiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red

So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already met him
And had married him before the sun went down
When the sheriff saw the coming down the highway
He saw they couldn't stop and so he held his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
He didn't slow it down at all and he lies there dead

God blessed him with a sharp eye and a quick hand

Still she prayed and she pleaded
But ranch work lacked the vengeance he needed
He was cursed on his daddy's dying day
When a shot to the back laid him in six feet in a grave

And he wears a star on his vest
The only thing between a bullet and the heart in his chest
He'll be a ranger till he takes his last draw
He was born with the strong arm of the law

He wore a colt 45 on his hip
One notch short on the ivory grip
Searching for the outlaw that broke his momma's heart
Riding through the badlands from daylight to dark

In a dirty back water border town
Where the outlaw thought he could not be found
He looked like he'd seen a ghost when he saw the ranger's face
A legacy to the lawman he sent to his resting-place

Chorus

The outlaw had no place to run
So he turned to the trigger on his gun
As the smoke cleared blood stained the dusty street
The outlaw lay dying at the ranger's feet

He sat in the saddle and shook his head
His gun still hot and his father still dead
As the sun set on the day he'd waited so long for

Found a girl to take his name

At the end of a long hard day
Life out there is easier to bear
When you look at me this way

I can't count the times
You dance through my mind
While I'm tryin' to be who I am
But you got to believe
I'm not really me
'Til I'm back in your arms again

'Cause it all comes clear
When we're both right here
And you lay your heart next to mine

I'll never get used to those short goodbyes
As I'm runnin' out the door
And I'll always hate walkin' away
While you're tryin' to kiss me once more

But I've got to do what I've got to do
And even when it don't go like I plan
I tell myself, if there's nothin' else
When every day comes to an end

It will be all right
When you hold me tight
And you lay your heart next to mine

Every beat
Every breath
That I have you here with me
Is worth all the rest, oh yes
And every dream
In my mind
Comes alive every night, every time

And the world stands still

The time has come...for bad things to leave
The time has come...for life to begin
The time has come...for the war of the gods

Yes..

It's that time
I'ma take the subtle approach first
Cause I'm just gettin started
Let's go

[1st Verse]
Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it
But keep runnin yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it

I never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man
Understand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga

Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today

So you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk
But real niggaz ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk
Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan
So call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man

[2nd Verse]
How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun
How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
Disrespectin those doin real time with real criminals

And I ain't never did a day in my life
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south

I give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME
I hear you talkin but you ain't made it to THREE
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME

You ain't made nigga
I'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga
You got played, my record label never jerked me
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me
I feed off your energy, my powers with God

That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
Will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

 _(Bring that on?)_ You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

The girl who loved the man who robbed the bank

Said his love was all she needed
But he said, ""I only did it for you
So don't you look at me that way.""

At Santa Fe and got away

He talked in his sleep and gave himself away
When he talked of another girl waiting in San Jose
With the same loving hands that thrilled him

That's why these broads grab my arm a lot and hold it tight
Flossy A's and money A's all night

And so I do teach the truth to the youth (Meanwhile)

How I would give you all I have and all I am

You got me defenseless, intoxicate me senseless
You cut me so deeply, I must confess

Baby, I can't breathe with my arms around you
Baby, I can't sleep 'cause now that I found you

Your love is like a weapon, girl, I can't live without you
You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart
You murder my heart, you murder my heart

I need to catch my breath with you sometimes
'Cause I get dizzy when your body's touching mine
Girl, you're killing me inside

If you need some satisfaction,
And if you need a quick reaction,
If you're tired of bein' lonely,

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ill,
Prescribe you all those different colored hard-to-swallow pills.

My prescription is the kind you'll love to have me fill.

If you need some satisfaction,
And if you need a quick reaction,
If you're tired of bein' lonely,
'Cause I can help you if you only take this heart of mine.

Got a love inside, that's pure as gold,
Take it's yours to have and to hold.
And if you do that baby, as we grow old,
Tell the greatest story that's ever been told.

Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
You showed me different and I know better now

Was never too good at finding the words to describe

The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack, the ripper, who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
And I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all that weeping and swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Well John, the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell, he points to the sky
Saying, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken""

The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Put the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him, he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
And I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now, I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
And I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players will now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank for a profit, sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks, home and the college

Now, I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

leaves me lost and lonely.

You can't believe that somehow it will stay faithfully yours.
And if you can find that you've got the time
for making love with me

'Cause tonight I'm feeling lonely
I need you just to hold me.

And if you don't really love me - tell me tomorrow

And if you don't really need me - save me the sorrow.
And I don't wanna hear the truth

and that ain't the way to start

I don't wanna hear no lies
'cause they would break my heart.
And if you don't really love me - tell me tomorrow !

With a passion strong I carry on with romance on my mind

Even though I've got to know the sadness of good-bye.
And just in time you get to find love was just a lie

Because I'm feeling lonely
I just want you to hold me.

Lookin' like the creature from the Black Lagoon
There's gonna be a 187 real soon
If some niggas don't give me some elbow room
I'm runnin with the Legion of Doom
Like a pack of wolves foamin at the mouth on full moon
I track range between space and time
And push back like receding hair lines
That's the essence of the effervescence
At this melodic dynamic shit progresses
A mic murderer for hire
As I sit back and watch your little gimmick backfire
Under the circumstances in any order of events
I be with sick niggaz rollin thick
Dissin the system got America mad at me
Like my name was O.J. Simpson

My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip
So fuck all that sensuous shit
The astronomical is comin through like the flu bombin you

Verse Two:

Get off my d.k. you pitty pat bitch, stepped into the party
People wonderin' if I'm a start some shit
Prisoner of the media very often
Cause people be blowin shit out proportion
False information and bogus arithmetic
Got everybody stuck on stupid, misinterpretating shit
How could I? Why should I damage my career?
Over a nigga that'll probably bust me out of fear
Don't let your mouth get you into somethin that your ass can't get out
When I see you I'm a pull your dreads out your scalp
Caution: code red
I could kill you now but instead I'm a put this thought into your head
I got the illest crew in the industry
We could go to war for 30 years like foreign countries
Yo slow your roll
Cause I don't really think you know with what you dealin

Verse Three:

Man fuck bitches I'm getting money
And laughin at these clown ass niggaz like they funny
The grand imperial with milky material
I be the surprise in the bottom of your cereal.
One thing I gotta say my Squad never lost it
Unlike you corny MC's out there who Farrah Fawcett
Can't rhyme runnin your mouth all the time
While Def Squad sit back and enterprise perfect crimes
Got the Funk Lord squeezin the life out of keyboards
While each MC tear the frame out of mic chords

I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in
And let a little light from heaven fills my soul.
He bathed my heart in love, and He wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole.

(Now let us) have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our fainted cry
(He will) answer by and by
(When you) feel a little prayer wheel turning
(And you) will know a little fire is burnin'
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

\--- Instrumental ---

I may have doubts and fears, my eye be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus make it right.

(Now let us) have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our fainted cry

What up world, this your people, the Excited Private
Fiend, better known as Sleepy Eyed Jones
I got a question to ask you, and understand me on this one
If life is a blessing, and truly a gift
Why in the hell it could end so quick
It could happen all in a week, knowI'msaying
Check this out

(Fiend)
Monday morning waking up before I brush my dogs
Loading clips to the tip why, cause haters test balls
Smoke a cess to ease it all, but I got to face pain
Push come to shove and I will, release flames
There's a war on these streets, it's the beginning of the week
Came night fall, a couple of bodies had to leak
A couple hotties had to beat them in, died a snitch
Lied in a ditch, they tried not to cry like a bitch
The eye witness, seen it all, but mouth stayed closed
Stayed at home praying, as tears drop from my nose
Suppose it was your boys, would you ride nine Tuesday
Grabbing whatever's spent even the old school uzi
Usually wouldn't be caught, doing these wrong deeds
Wednesday, wanna know, they done fucked with the wrong breed
My girl Chrissy said Fiend, why you wear a vest
Besides the life I live girl the streets is a mess, it happened all in a week

(Chorus: O'Dell vocalizing in background)
If life is a blessing, and truly a gift
Why in the hell it could end so quick
If you thinking the streets is bad, is really a myth
You'd be surprised what your ass might get

(Fiend)
Now, came Thursday, yeah my dog Rover his
The devil called who in the fuck taking care of them four kids
The more I did, with a firm grip, I couldn't shake the thoughts
I tried to drink the pain away, enough liquor wasn't bought
Saw some good news, like a quest for some gold
My girl sleeped with that other day, bless her soul
Glock I hold, got paper, wrapping niggas for nothing
Plus I'm tripping on these hoes, and get it all done with something
Blunting, to keep my composer, No Limit Soldier
Trouble seems to find me, in the Navi or the Rover
Fuck being sober, it ain't the weekend yet
Plus some jackers tried to follow, me and Serv in the Vet

(Chorus)

(Fiend)
Probably even tripping how them boys, chase the wealth
Followed to I 10 them boys sure killed theyself
Hell, been not feeling a thang, behind mine
In search of being heard they surely don't mind dying
Picture, what happens, in time on this day
Chronic got me wanting to sleep on the sixth day
Mix playing the N.Y., Vix paying the N.O.
Both, your niggas drinking, blowing some indo
Send for, Saturday, that's when the Cali play
Over that a-way, a man stand in the alley way
Make it to the club, fuck, he popping lips
Hit him, I got that torch straw anxious at my hip
Shit got thick, and real niggas had to leave
I went throwing heat, like I was in the major league
Shit, ready for combat including the gun play
The priest gone be tripping come confessions on Sunday

(Chorus - 2x)

Alone on this small place, called earth.

And living and dying and birth.

Dragging my own tombstone Dragging my own tombstone

I could handle toil and trouble
When it brought better times
But time hangs heavy on my hands
Slipping by me, over again on that production line

Not lost for the working man
You let that chisel fall from your hand
Now is the time to pick your fight
I can't make everything right

I will find that precious jewel
Just drove in from Indiana
The neon canyons, calling home another fool

Old stinking hat and shoes
Fat white suburban blues

This lucky day is mine, all mine.

This isn't intended for me, I don't think.
It's a missive from the edge of despair, I mean brink
of total desperation; the communication therein
says her hopes for survival are slim
and she's writing to the Front, though we've yet to meet,
with a confidential matter cause she's heard I'm discreet.
And the urgency of her request for my aid
is matched by the depth of the trust she displayed.
""Don't betray me like our oil minister did, staged a coup
and I'm about to flee Nigeria soon
but I'll never make it out,"" she says, with twenty million
three hundred twenty thousand U.S. dollars that are still in
her possession. She embezzled them, I guess.
Look, I don't really know her so uh... that's none of my business.
She's the LADY MARYAM ABACHA, deposed.
These days can't even get her caps-lock key unfroze
but yo, something 'bout a widow in distress
(with 20 million dollars hidden in a metal chest)
softened up the Frontalot's heart no doubt
so I hit the reply button, tell her I can help her out.

She writes me back: DEAR FRONTALOT, UNITED STATES...
She acts so thankful. A bank full of money awaits!
And I hate delays so I'm quick to turn around
with my full name and the number to my checking account
and the scan of my license to drive an automobile
and my passport number proving Frontalot's for real!
Then I'll meet the money in Stockholm, ain't gonna walk home,
think I'll retire to the south of Spain and sip gazpacho.
Not so quick, there's a little problem.
LADY A apparently had difficulty running all them
numbers I give her, but look, the fake ID's my only one
and that's a real passport, I got it off usenet and checked,
I'm not dumb. I'm not some idiot
who's about to lose your money for you, quicker than I'm getting it
and of course my bank balance is negative, whose isn't?
It's why I need your 20% money laundering commission.
And I'm wishing I could talk about this further with you but I can't.
I just got an email from DR. UBUGU of Chad.
He's got a hundred and seventy-seven million in a bag.
I feel I got to help him 'cause his story is so sad.

Because I show love to the true thugs on the back lot
Post up at the biggest crack spots
Raised around killers so eventually I popped shots
(Make em feel your real) Niggaz stop playin on the real
Fuck around you get your death wish from Bill(D-yea)
This cat sucker got the wrong idea
(He came a long damn way) How the hell you think I got here?
I learned to survive with illegal guns that know how to hide
Homicide ties, baby, yea, I dominates what you tryin to do
I wear my hat broke down and play the war when I'm sliding through
I gotta crew (Original Hilfiger)
Plus triggers and some of Brooklyn's illest niggers

I keep in touch with myself so I can feel the real niggaz pain

Verse 2: Lil' Fame

(Time flies) Slugs fly, people die (Damn)
Guerilla warfare all across the land
If they break the code of silence (leave em all dead)
And fools take a fall when I call (code red)
More people travellin, like immigrants
But on the low with the most dominant (most infinite)
Lost in your track so I act innocent
But on the low, I can act real motherfucking ignorant
Raised by an army of THUGS
who done it all from the smartest to the dumbest
And I, happen to be the youngest
Twenty-two years of being brave as a lion
And that's, with or without the iron
Fools wanna (STRESS YA), then they wanna (TEST YA)
Then you gotta get your steel (Deal with the pressure)
I ain't gotta teach a fucking family to bury me
You think your bullshit worry me?
Aiyo, I move quickly, but come across so humble
Fools be on point when its time for the rumble
W-O-M-A-C-K, (hit ya)
With the game plan that will twist ya, (mista)

Verse 3

Billy Danze: We gonna put this bullshit to a cease
Hollering about peace; you in the belly of the fucking beast

And since I laid my mother to rest
I been blessed with these cold heart

(If he's against us) Fuck him, (If he ain't with us) Fuck him
(We be aight, nigga) That's right, nigga
(We tight, nigga) What's more
(When we don't like niggaz) We'll invite niggaz to war

Lil' Fame: And believe we've got lead to give em
Thugs that perform massacres, like nazism
This living mechanism, study living to the end
Discombobulation, then I'm Gone With the Wind (begin)

Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die

I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all

Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done

'Cause, as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all

And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

That I may see, the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day

And ever firmly take a stand

Would end with ay hug

Than the power of love

When I fixed his little plane

We won't be afraid to be alive any more

And we'll grow kindness in our hearts
For all the strangers among us
Till there are no strangers anymore

Don't bring me bad news, no bad news

Took me to Atlanta tied me to a ball and chain

And put a man a super door

Still standing where giants have stood
They're bleeding now

Maybe they would

Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?

I thought I knew him well; I really coudn't tell,
That he had another lover on his mind.
You see, it felt so right when he held me tight,
How could I be so blind?

which is which you decide. Only one thing will outlast both armies, only one
thing will survive in the end. And that special magical little item, is that
of which we call the hollow tipped bullet)
Sit back and let me take you into the mind of a killa
Dark carnival, psychopathic wig splitta (anybody!)
Mood changes, time to rearrange
So love a dinosaur that you can't tame
I bring pain, what you think I'm playing a game
Detroit is my home, Eastside's what I claim
F**k a balla, I represent the 313
With Tek 9's and green trees, it's a luxury
This how it is and I ain't changing for shit
F**k the earth, mean mugging, waiting for someone to trip
I'm sick and tired of f**king waiting for you wanna be
Thugs to quit, that's why I keep it underground
And drop the killa shit, for juggalos that keep it real non-stop
Keep away from juggahos till I load up my glock
Cause in Detroit we got mothaf**king problems
And all the gunplay that you hear is my homies trying to solve them

I can tell you, watch the trigger, things will never be the same
You can't tell me anything, hollow points control the game
I can tell you, watch the trigger, things will never be the same
I gotta brand new Tek, that I'm dieing to use
Play games with this killa and your destined to lose
Mental stress, keeping me alive
Sniffing lines of gunpowder to start off the night
Curbside gangbanging with some mark ass bitches
Gunsmoke from bullet holes leaves you dead in the ditches
I'm just an average individual, street slanging convict
Pocket full of bullets, ready to use them up quick
You ask my name (ABK!), you know the game ain't changed
Labeled as a killa, busting caps all the same
As any other mothaf**ka with a piece, and a little bit of attitude
Running through the streets, acting rude
So hate if you want to, but I'ma keep my focus
And continue with the magic that I practiced with the Lotus (LOTUS!)
Psychopathic, and I'm down for life, and anyone who dissagree
Let these hollow points change ya mind!

You can't tell me anything, hollow points control the game
I can tell you, watch the trigger, things will never be the same
You can't tell me anything, hollow points control the game
I can tell you, watch the trigger, things will never be the same
I feel the urge to murder, theres no need to cure me
Seven lives, under the light, at night, I'm filled with fury
Is it true that the people who you hang with, rub off?
Is that why me and Violent J love cutting bitches heads off?
Imagine everytime you woke up, you was getting choked up
And had to grab a shank and slit a throat up
The types of shit most people call unreal
But its the thing that makes you feel, the way to deal, is just to kill
Crazy, ballistic, cause my head is a train
With the empty f**king wallet so there's so much to gain
If I appeal to you, do you think I keep it real with you?
Turn my back and let my hollow points drill into you
What type of person do you think that I am?
Because we had a conversation and afterwards we shook hands (How ya doing?
What's up?)
Don't get it in your head that I would never hurt you
Cause the ones that getting shot are the ones that deserve to

[Intro:]

Let me ask you a question: Have you ever been shackled on a bus?
Are you afraid to die? Most of y'all niggas never did bids. Your hands
Never got dirty. Me, myself, I'm a thug - and I live and die for this
Shit. 25 To Life - the entity - forever and ever. Yo...

[Imam T.H.U.G.:]

Yo, they label us bastards
Raised in pen maxes
Hydro - blow 'til I burn in platinum ashes
Make it hard for niggas who blast, try and get at this
Two-Five - flooded with thugs in black mas'es
Station me ?, pants sag, divine masters
Comin' with drugs - o.d., your brain's captured
See my life condemned to weed and chrome biscuits
Ghetto sheist' fake emcees and crack infants
Murder one - killer disease my life sentence
Exit one - enter with truth, combined vengeance
Who'd ever think - we could blow and be spectacular?
Thug blazin' my gun, still comin' after ya
Tackle ya - bent, I snatch you out the Acura
Or Lex' bubble - scuffle, rise when you tumble
Bloodsucker - won't be sweet when mine's touch ya
Now pass that - lyrically strapped, attack that

[Chorus x2:]
Yo, black gloves, black mask
Sit at the table like the Maffia and life ya glass
When it's time to go to war, who be the first to blast?
Real niggas shoot first and ask questions last

[Tragedy Khadafi:]
Yo, my last days on the Earth, bury me in the Bridge
My worst fear is a stray bullet killin' a kid
Born and raised where the fiends live
My pops did a state bid
All my niggas is locked and full of hatred
We can't make it
Caught in the beast, tied naked
That's why I spit immortal thug shit on every record
It's thug apparel
Resurrect the crime pharaoh
My thoughts travel
Like hollow tips through the barrel
It's all official
I hold a laser beam tryin' to hit you
My team died and came back, that's how we come to get you
My Arab missile penetratin' through your body tissue
Kidnap your wife and your kids - make it a foul issue
Cime rate, violate, guerrilla mind state
We all tryin' to escape - clappin' at the jakes(pap)
The holy wars - my soul be inside of yours
For all my niggas who brawl - locked behind the walls
For all my niggas who brawl - locked behind the walls

[Chorus x2]

Yo, yo
My life every day livin' Henney and weed
I know I need to slow down my speed
The police break me off with somethin' I don't need
Have me caught up in the law 'til I'm forced to bleed
My niggas fall on the floor and give Allah they plea
While this black cloud follows everywhere I be
Have me scared up in the mirror at the man I see
Flip constantly - 'cause my lady killed my seed
Took his life - 'fore he even had a chance to breathe
Said she killed him 'cause she didn't want him growin' like me
Like the Godfather Part III as far as I see
Try to stop me? I thought we had love, acqui
Older niggas comin' home, younger niggas get stuck
It's like - havin' weed and not havin' a dutch
Type fucked up - knowin' that you could get bucked
Leave the 'hood, try to come back, and then get stuck
Leave the 'hood, try to come back, and then get stuck

I was on the south road
Headed for Savannah
I was tired of being poor
Didn't suit me anymore
I'd sung up all the songs you dream on
Trying to stay ahead
The dollar I had left to live on
I'd drank it down instead
When I run up on this stranger in the dirt
and he looked like some unfinished dirty work
He was barely breathing
Wasn't nothing left to say
I helped myself and took his gun
He was dying anyway

I was down in Texas
Barely two months later
I had found myself a name
I had stumbled into fame
I shot a man from Louisiana
with the strangers gun
He never even cleared his leather
before the shot had run
And I'd never shot a six-gun in my life
So it's strange to me
How I could take a life
Now they're telling me I'm faster
Than any living man
It must have been black magic
I was holding in my hand

If I take it off they'll shoot me down
If I wear it someone dies
The devil made that deadly thing
You know I do not lie
I don't believe in fortune
I do believe in sin
It must have been black magic
In that gun that done him in

I was riding across the border
Just outside Durango
When a bullet split the night
Off behind me to my right
I never saw the coward's face
I never got no plan
I tried to get a shot off
I never got the chance
And the pain was like no pain I'd ever known
So I was satisfied I'd die alone
I was barely breathing
Wasn't nothing to be said

A lot more than what we see in America
I think it's just healthy to be aware
So I want to take you with me
As we travel the globe
And see the problems and see the pain
And see our only hope
Is through Jesus Christ
To redeem our world, let's go

See it's more suffering in the world
Than we see on the streets
Open your eyes step away from MTV
See into CNN and see in the Middle East
Places like Iraq, Iran, the UAE
See the murder
The rape
Religions
The pain
The terror
The poverty diseases in the veins
See our desperate need for change as we travel the globe
And see our only hope is Jesus grabbing a soul
Look at Africa actually one of the places
Where 24 million people living with AIDS is
Where rape is half of the women experience violence
Orphans guerilla warfare break the silence
Vulnerable African children go hungry
While we in the states we waste money
12 years olds traded for sex
We need Jesus what type of suffering is next
Even Europe has problems
Think a place like Greece
Where they smuggle Cannabis and heroin from the Middle East
The assaults the car theft and drug offenses
Illicit drugs and rape exist
Though they can never rate with the USA
We number 1 on the list for most criminal cases
Though we living in the free land and free to vote
But yet we still slaves to sin?
Welcome to I-N-D-I-A
Where 63 out of a thousand children die before the age of 5
5.1 million people with AIDS alive
Mad pollution in the Asian sky
Millions of children live and they work and on the streets
One of the poorest countries that this world will ever see
And 10 million babies died from abortions in two decades
That's more of a reason for you to get saved
Look at China and see the way they treat the females
They drown them and poison them
I give you the details
It overwhelms me the magnitude of they sinning
When over 60 million babies never grow to be women
Violent crimes on the rise prostitution is rising
Drug addition plus they persecuting they Christians
The most populated country with 3 billion people
Needs to look up so they can see the point like a steeple
In Israel
Terrorism is real
Can't imagine the amounts of blood that gets spilled
Many people displaced from the bombs dropping
Judaism Christianity Islam's doctrine
Civil war taking place in the Holy land
While peoples homes getting crushed like a soda can
As the children sit and watch the crossfire
Other countries plead for peace to cease fire
Jamaica Wah Gwan
I guess I get to tell
15 percent of the people have sickle cell
In this third world where gang violence is
It's prevalent, it's evident all the Godlessness
The drug traffic ganja and cocaine
With so much cocaine you can skid on a slope main
But when Jesus Christ died recognize that hope came
So fight the sex trade and racism for sho main
See in Cuba people submerged in repression in fear
From 48 years Fiedel Castro is their Prime Minister Counsel of ministers
Also referred to as Premier
Prostitution is high and the crime is too
Can't express your ideas like you and I can do
In America democracy is what we're use to
But I'm just trying to remind you that
See it's more suffering in the world than we see on the streets

What a crime - beats is the same way
Make 'em wanna hit the streets with the heat for a lame's pay
Game day, flag on the play, improper helmet
Drag on the suede from the gem drop of well spit
He didn't listen, titty kissin the city glistened
Depending on what from what position you're sittin
In the pissy wind, is this thing whistlin?
Who let the spinnin whisperin djinn in?
The Villain again? Without a doubt
That's his name, don't play it out
Or spray it, when you say it out your mouth
Then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
And told him take a gold shower, for fakin funk, soul power
... stocky, short and cocky
Looked like Apollo Creed after he fought with Rocky
Rhymed in a broken english slang, not cockney
Thirteen, his first queen wore hot knock knees
Had to tell her pops, yo stop cockblockin B
Hold somethin for your daily yay habit
Then go, bada-bing-bing-bing like ricochet rabbit
How 'bout the sicko say stab it?
There's liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crap pit
And Heineken, I told him much obliged friend
What I gotta spend, if I only touch her thighs then?
... why his eyes widened
He didn't know your man had a nice surprise hidin
Took pride in ridin in a sly wiseguy grin
... real recognize real
On the microphone, the wheels are mechanized steel
Please, at least respect your ideals
How you got her walkin along the stroll in high heels?
He said her mamma was gettin old
God bless her poor soul, now no more drama is your role
Straight to the head
He know a lot of haters can't wait 'til he dead
Lead to go, like a ho, to a strange whack housewife
Only thing he know will change his back do', how trife
Rules is rules, don't go there
Stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
Keep a snotty chicken on E, the Lone Ranger
Why everybody always pickin on Danger?
... and Doom, maybe it's him
Called up my lady, told her baby it's slim
Make me up a margarita I need to take a swim
Tell them kids remember school - if they let 'em out, cool
But get the hell from out the pool

I never thought I'd feel this way - memories haunting every breath
it frightens me to know I can never be rid of you
after a year, you still stir something in me
the hate has faded but the disgust remains.
I recall when only warmth and acceptance filled your eyes.
If I could understand - what turned you against me
if I could just understand - what hardened your stare into scorn
what was it worth to you - to turn me inside out?
You became he that we hated - left me with scarlet eyes
and an empty chest - its been a year and I still feel nauseous
brown eyes cut into me - parting once friendly flesh
I burned your pictures away - but I can't stop remember when
the city has not felt the same since
though your stare has hardened - this cold contempt makes me wonder
could an ounce of guilt boil in your blood?
This blood we shared - seeps from an ever present truth
a missing piece of my past - still makes me crawl the other way
no I can't forgive - as you embody my regret
you are the living proof - that I'll never ever trust again
I never really told you what you had meant to me
ere my lungs met the ire of your voracious mouth.
So now I walk alone through the ashes of our ties.

Pulling on the trigger as the sweat runs from my lip

My religious beliefs are to kill snitches and any b*****s that beef
Your grill in stitches, get buried inside a ditch in your briefs
Life is enslavement and suffering, crazy snuffings, attacks
Overdosing like David Ruffin, craving, puffing some crack
Hell is endless and friendless to the Hitlers, Mangols, and Himmlers
Mangled, ripped to pieces by characters like Pinhead, no forgiveness
Reincarnated as God and Satan, logical psycho sadist
My cadence hits like razorblade tips of invader invaded
Corresponding with demons, bonded in blood
Like the Ugandan president Idi genocide like Rwandans in bondage
Devine comedy, mind lobotomy, due the math like Ptolemy
A bloodbath, you're split in half, dichotomy
The honorable, horrible, incorrigible, adorable death oracle
Beautiful like a funeral floral, you heard the stories: Murdering for glory
Sent to purgatory for doing something perverted and gory

[Chorus: Everlast]

When your heart won't beat, your eyes go black
There's a light in the tunnel and you can't turn back
Your friends can't save you, your family's gone
You're waiting on your judgment at the foot of the throne
Will you beg for some mercy? Will you cop some pleas?
Will you stand on your own or get down on your knees?
Will your angels release you from where demons dwell?
Will you make it into Heaven or go right back to Hell?
Only time will tell, only time will tell
Only time will tell, only time will tell

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]

I fall upon my knees like Lord forgive me
Out of the commandments I've broken ten out of ten now
Blasting me, past in me because now Satan's my pen pal
Part of me Asmodeus, the other side is an evangelist
God gave me melodious but I'm sick, psycho, and scandalous
Outbursts like bismillah, hallelujah
On the other hand I lust for flesh in my quest for gouda
Shaboombala boopy time, I choose and the coochie's mine
My booze through ? nine and I ooze at a groupie dime
But the seas got more patnas
Everything dead, blasting at ? patwa
Trying to bring you peace but the beast brings forth kaka
I really feel like I hate you but it's eep opp ork ah-ah
You don't know what that means? Then ask Jet Screamer
Trash that lingers will cause the enemies to blast that femur
Only time will tell if I crash between her
God forgive me I'm torn because I'm an angel
With a crass demeanor

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]

For whom the bell tolls, it's the clock, tick tick tick
The truth is the future is now
How many lifetimes have I taken you through in this hour?
I trust nobody cause Babylon destroyed my uncle
So many lessons I've applied to my life that taught me to function
In this hell on the earth the dark clouds have silver linings
Until the lightning strikes down upon the unrighteous and frightening
The non-believers like eighty year old atheists on their death bed
Crying and begging for forgiveness from God
Atrocities committed against mankind
Monstrosities that span time leaving impressions of hatred in man's mind
Don't let time trap you, it's vital that you realise that there's a new
beginning
At the ending of the hour of reprisal

Following misguided dreams
What have we done? We've gone too far...

Unwise to the world, we're told what to see
Force-fed a life so sugary sweet
Never questioning the world around us
Never dared to look inside...

Inner darkness that betrays the night
Is this the world we wanted?
Somehow we've lost our way...
We've lost our way...

So far removed from life
Everything we see on TV, the music we hear,
The games we play
Twisted and diluted to ""protect us""
Is it any wonder our children
Are looking elsewhere for the truth?
Feeling the anger rise when they learn
It's all been lies...

Deprived of the truth, we're told what to feel
Accepting their words, a world beyond real
What once began with the best intentions
Somehow ended up as lies...

To St. George's Hill
A ragged band
They called the Diggers
Came to show the people's will
They defied the landlords
They defied the laws
They were the dispossessed
Reclaiming what was theirs

We come in peace, they said
To dig and sow
We came to work
The lands in common
And to make the waste ground grow
This earth divided
We will make whole
So it will be
A common treasury for all

The sin of property
We do disdain
No man has any right to buy and sell
The earth for private gain
By theft and murder
They took the land
Now everywhere the walls
Spring up at their command

They make the laws
To chain us well
The clergy dazzle us with heaven
Or they damn us into hell
We will not worship
The god they serve
The god of greed who feeds the rich
While poor folk starve

From the men of property
The orders came
They sent the hired men and troopers
To wipe out the Diggers' claim
Tear down their cottages
Destroy their corn
They were dispersed
But still the vision lingers on

You rich take care
This earth was made a common treasury
For everyone to share
All things in common

He sits at home with his feet on his desk
While the boys got theirs in the sand

For a photo op with the smoking gun
He's got Purple Heart and American blood on his hands

Black gold for silver stars
Cold hard cash for armored cars
The brass ain't fighting but they're sure as hell taking a stand
And they'll have to live with American blood on their hands

The roadside bombs for six long years were never really part of the plan
What's a couple thousand more with American blood on their hands?

I can't believe you're gone and
You still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly

I never knew what it was to be alone....no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always the waiting

But now I come home
And I miss your face so
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

And I know
You're a part of me
And its your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me

I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of the one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me

I never knew what it was to be alone....no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always the waiting

But now I come home
And its not the same no
It feels empty and alone
I can't believe you're gone

And I know
You're a part of me
And it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me

I'm glad He set you free from sorrow
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you'll be here
With me still

All you did you did with feeling
And you always found a meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will

The only thing worse is hearing you now
Plant your seeds of doubt
When the love I found
Is on solid ground

And found someone now you want me
The way you know I use to want you
But it's too late because we're through
Why is it
Someone else had to love me
For you see all that I could be
This love for me has new meaning
And when you find it you never ever let it go

You telling me you could
Be understanding of the things you shoulda understood
Sorry but I'm not who you knew when you broke my heart into

Plant your seeds of doubt
When the love I found
Is on solid ground

CHORUS

Now that I'm in love
And found someone now you want me
All i gave of me were things you asked me - but -wasn't enough
Don't want disappoint you but don't waste your time cuz
Love's got hold on my heart-body- soul - and mind
There's no need call me anymore
If you are looking for - the love we had don't live here any more

CHORUS

Now that I'm in love

Gets harder every day.
Somebody's gotta do the job, ya know?
So it might as well be me.

Bought himself a one way ticket,
On a greyhound bus bound for Santa Fe,
Left everyone behind he'd ever known,
Just faded away...

Jimmy found himself,
A lover down in Hollywood.
He was a good man,
As far as good men go, I guess.

He sold system software for a high tech firm down in the valley,
She wrote him a letter,
It went a little something like this.

She said I had big dreams, big dreams don't you know?
So hard to make these big dreams come true.
Now I try to hold on to what we had the best I could.
I find holdin on is the hardest thing to do.

Oh I ain't comin home tonight,
So don't wait up for me.
No I ain't coming home tonight,
Well I'm finally free.

Was a guy that I met one night in a bar in Colorado,
He said, man I got a gift, more like a curse, I must confess.
Said I can remember everybody's name that I've ever met before in my life,
So i said, name everybody in your first grade class, and he did, I guess.

And then imagine all those names,
Stretched out forever,
Like the rays of light,
From some long dead distant star.

And I thought to myself,
What have I done with this life of mine?
Besides finding myself in this smoke-filled bar,
And I said,

Oh I ain't comin home tonight,
No don't wait up for me.
No I ain't comin home tonight,
Said I'm finally free,
I'm finally free.

And time rolls by,
Like an old friend gone away.
And I am just a mortal man,
And death will be my final lover,
And life will always be something that I'll never understand.

And now I'm higher than a capitol building in downtown Austin,
Freer than the west Texas wind,
And I move down the street like a cloud moving across a clear blue sky,
And I know I'll never feel this way again.

Oh I ain't coming home tonight,
So don't wait up for me.
No I ain't coming home tonight,
Oh I'm finally free,
I'm finally free,

Drawing circles in the sand
Facing still a final solution
All the time I spent in vain
Focusing the right shape
Scattered lost fancying the abyss
Just another confirmation
Of mess within your brain
I'm the man inside the mirror
Feed my anger and be free
Separate the scars
Analyze the static parts
Of my constant fall from reality
I am trapped inside a cage
With bars of anger
And lock of rage
And I still can't find a way out

It seems you're getting closer
To the point of no return
Don't you long to drown your tears in me
And resurrect within my blood
And as time slips through my hands
I can't withstand
The tears you shed and all the pain you still hide inside
Forever craving for the past
With blood-red hatred in my brain
Wasted and torn

[Chorus:]
Grant me a way out
How many times you crossed that line
Don't come any closer
How many times you lost your mind
Facing your failure

Give me a chance to show you
All the things you hide inside
Accept your nature and be free

Forcing me between the edges

Love has no end, love is life
Love is a language,love is a word
Love is confusion,love is absurd
Love makes us laugh,and love makes us cry
We can't understand love,why do we try
Love is a teacher love is a fool
Love is the gift I give to you
Love is the kiss on your lips as you sleep
Love is our strength and love makes us weak
Love is the wind that fills up the soil
Love is love and love will not fail

On the shattered skulls in the battleground.

The old, the sick, the dying and the isolated ones
Ancient language turns obscene
Between the goal posts of a circular dream.

Who's gonna save us from these shrunken heads ?

On a windy day where no one smiles
On a pleasureless beach on a go-go-golden mile
In a sad cafe eating day old bread
And I tip the angry actress with pockets full of shrunken heads.

Windows barred, exhausted dull
And the smell of decay is miserable
Dangerous streets where the dealers rule
Lie litter strewn around a frozen school.

Your head is full of snakes, you know, you're better red than dead
They're starving back in China, boy, that's what they always said
Can't get head in the head shop, your jeans are full of crap
You're full of beans, you're in your teens
You lost your mama's road map

Saw you in the street one day
Walking up to you,
Just wanted just to say baby.
Instantly you looked the other way
You grabbed a lady's hand
Then you kissed the head of her little man
Started thinkin' should I blow him up?
Tell her who I am?
Tell we've been making so many plans?
But instead I left
And I just cried 'cuz I was broke inside.
Now I wanna know the reason why.

VsII
So tell me why do this to me?
Why do this to her?
And why'd you do this to your baby?
I loved you for your honesty
But it was just a lie
(Bkgd.: Don't you know the way I'm feeling inside?)
You can't imagine how I feel
Thinking you were real then to find out we're nothing
I've been living in a faded dream
But reality quickly hit me
When I saw you with her

Hook
Saw you walking by me
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name
Baby in your wifey's arms
Breakin' up my heart
You're a married man playing games
Wish somebody told me 'fore I let you hold me
'fore I let you in my bed
Never would've let you stay
Made you go away
You're a married man playing games.

Bridge
I can't believe you've been with me
While you were keeping home with her
So now I am the other girl in your other world
And I didn't even know I was
You really thought that you could be with me
While you were keeping secrets
But all that's dark will come to light
Baby that ain't right!

Sucka-ass nigga caught a slug in the liver
Layin' on the concrete bleedin out the kidney
Fuckin with a young G, got buck quickly
Dropped the gat in his drawers, gave up his set
Spit a loogie on his chest showing no regret
A murder-man, killa, mad at the world
Natural born, jackin bitches for diamonds and pearls
Come bangin' on my door, 15's stacked
I answered with the Mac cause I'm sittin' on Yac

I front them caine on the spot cause money is survival

You can't fuck with a criminal
I fill your shit with holes then send your ass to your funeral
Then who knows, the getaway scheme
Back three's through the G to my house in the tree
I'm livin low, but most of it's high
Cotton mouth the most I think I'll blame it on the buddah thai
And that's why, I live off the gat

So could you come back, I don't know--later?

Oh, they're turned down
Turned upside down

Short and tall, crowded wall to wall, nearing sleep

Will we ever get some peace?
Sent away till another day when he'll walk among them
So a man, knocking once again, bringing peace
There are those of the young and old who will not recieve
Saying, ""man, we have no need.""

Still no room in the inn
Turned away once again
Wants to save everyone but no saving is done
Till there's room in the end

Long ago, yeah well maybe so,
But not much as changed since then
Pride and sin keep resisting him and always will
Don't need toys to lead someone to joy
It's for this he's watching, waiting, knocking still

Still no room in the inn
Turned away once again
Wants to save everyone but no saving is done
Till there's room...

Inside, outside, or upside down
While forever beckons to us
We serve the moth and the rust
We showed ourselves in
Let's open the inn and let him in

Came to save everyone but no saving is done

it doesn't mean that much to me
it's the little things you do
the little things you say
it's the love you give along the way

when we patch things up
they say a job well done
but when we ask why
where did the rips come from
they say we are subversive

we are just trying to track a problem to its source

Awake but still I'm dreaming, I bring the sun into my bed.
I'll take you while you're sleeping and love you in the dark.

Hold me closer, in cold and hunger
My love uncovered, I can be the...
Pain that you're feeling
Be the breath upon your ear.
Be the love, love that you're bleeding
The sigh that you hear.

Share in good fortune, happiness is coming my way.
Fresh as new born babies, find me in a daze.
Pass the bottle slowly, and take what you can spare
Hold me closer���.

All you sleepy children with staring eyes
So many questions
I'll try to answer but please don't ask me why

I wake to find you dreaming
Smell the sunshine in your hair.
A dusty road adventure
Caught the seas beneath my stare.
Driving to the city, my love is in your hands.
Hold me closer���",annotator_y,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But I'm just wastin' time, and wastin' water, too
I'm hanging out these nights, in these twilight worlds
With all the late-night news, and the weather-girls
No-one here but me, so I sit and cheer,
Watchin' sports t.v., sipping luke-warm beer
I can take the pain, I can stand the rain
But what I cannot bear, is that bum givin' you his name

I'd like to tell all the whole wide world,
What a cryin' shame this is
But I get tongue-tied up,
Just tryin' to say my name without sayin' his

What kind of a man am I? givin' up on love without a try
Thought what we had was, like, a special thing,
Now I find your wearin' that bum's ring!
And what kind of a girl are you,
Tell me you love me then you tell him, too
Guess I'll be wonderin' 'til the day I die,
What kind of man am I?

It's a cryin' shame, what's become of me
I'm not half the man, that I used to be
And it's you's to blame, with your dirty tricks
Give a dog a name, you'd best beleave it sticks

I can't compete with the fancy cars
And the limousines he owns
But there's a heart beatin' ten feet tall
Inside of all of this skin an' bones

What kind of a man am I? I read the papers,
Let the world go by
I let him walk you right through the door,
When I should'a punched him on the jaw
And what kind of a girl are you,
Tell me you love me then you tell him, too
Too dumb to laugh and too proud to cry,
What kind of man am I?

It's bad enough tryin' to hold my head up
On the streets of our tiny town
If ther's a God up in heaven,
I wonder if he'd send a bolt of lightnin' down?

What kind of a man am I?
I'd love to tell you but I'm too damn shy
I stood an' let him give me all that grief,
When I should'a kicked him in the teeth!
And what kind of a girl are you,
Tell me you love me then you tell him too
Guess I'll be wonderin' 'til the day I die,

you've been telling me lies

Even the day when we met
I'll always recall with the deepest regret
Tell me what keeps you awake:
Talk of the angel or soul of the snake?
How can you live in your shadow from within
Hiding away from the light in the river of sin?

Lies, neverinding lies, I see it in your eyes
Did you stop believing ?
Lies always cold as ice, even heaven cries
for you, but not forgiving
Lies ' the way to paradise you're gonna pay the price
on the field of growing lies
Neverending lies need a sacrifice '
you're the one who's going down
